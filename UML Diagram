The Calculator class has one private attribute, memory, which stores the current result of previous operations.

The Calculator class has public methods for performing basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. These methods take two parameters (x and y) and return the result of the operation. Each method updates the memory attribute with the result.

The Calculator class also has a clearMemory method which sets the memory attribute to 0, effectively resetting the calculator to its initial state.

This simple class diagram demonstrates the basic structure of a calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations. With this class diagram, we can begin implementing the calculator application in Java, making use of the Calculator class and its methods.

One potential problem that could be addressed with a Java solution is a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). This application will use an interface to define the operations and handle errors using exception handling.

Here's a sample implementation:

In this solution, we define the Calculator interface that defines the basic arithmetic operations. We then implement this interface with the BasicCalculator class that provides the implementation for each operation.

The divide method uses exception handling to throw an ArithmeticException if the second argument is zero. The main method takes input from the user and calls the appropriate method based on the user's choice. The program also handles invalid inputs and exceptions gracefully using error messages and System.exit().
